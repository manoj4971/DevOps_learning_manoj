### what is a Hashicrop vault?
  --> This is an automated secret management tool for securely storing and accessing secrets like authentications or authorizations to a system.
  --> Vault secures, stores, and gives controlled access to the tokens, passwords, and controls APL keys and to other system settings.
  --> Vault can be executed through docker-compose, helm..etc.
## Note:
  --> The  http port number for vault: 3200 
### Types of authentications to the users:
  --> The user or system should prove the proof of identity to a server or client to access the information or data.
      1) password-based
      2) token-based
      3) Bio-metric based
      4) certificate-based
      5) multifactor based  
### Difference between the batch token and service token:
   -> service token: It is a general vault token where people normally think of, but it creates a child token by varying code number from parent token number,
                    child token code will be revoked when the token expires. It is heavyweight to track and create the token.
   -> Batch token: batch token are encrypted with varying dynamic time outs, It  carries only useful information to the vault actions,
                   So therefore no storage disk is required and the token is extremely lightweight
